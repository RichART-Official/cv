        p.caption Rotterdam, NL
    p.introduction.block Richard van 't Hof is a Rotterdam based audiovisual maker and digital artist. His work is on the verge of film, design and code. He is fascinated by it's emersive quality. His work focuses much on the question of this control. Especially in the question of how much control he can have over his surroundings and other people but also himself. He works with an autonimous, theoretical mindset to disect subjects around him from which he can gain unexpected insights. With these connections he plays visually. In this he likes to mix the analog and digital in his work.
